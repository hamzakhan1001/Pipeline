# Matomo Funnels Plugin

## Description

See how your audience flows through your marketing funnels. Find where your visitors drop off, fill in the gaps, and watch your conversions soar.

Getting a coherent view of your funnels can feel like assembling a jigsaw puzzle with missing pieces. One website change disrupts your users' behaviour, and you're left guessing what went wrong—especially when you can't pinpoint how your audience segments interact with your funnel.

With the Funnels plugin, you can spot exactly where your visitors enter and exit a funnel and how many proceed to each of the next steps. Break down any conversion goal and boost your conversions, one step at a time.
