        "SettingMaxActionsDescription": "A default of  \"0\" records all actions. Most sites usually have no more than 100 to 300. It might be safe to assume other activity is tracking spam, a bot or an attack. Matomo stops recording further actions and blocks their IP addresses for up to 24 hours to reduce server load and preserve data accuracy.",

It should be safe to turn on if you are only tracking using the JavaScript tracker, as their tracking requests do not orginate from clouds, unless they use a VPN that routes data through cloud providers. The setting applies to all your sites.",

        "SettingBlockServerSideLibrariesDescription": "Use this if only using %1$sJavaScript Tracker%2$s, as other traffic will be attacks or spam anyway.
