# Matomo ActivityLog Plugin

## Description

Review any actions performed by employees or clients. Find potential security breaches, enhance your accountability, and foster a culture of transparency.

You're meticulous about your data, yet the thought of unnoticed actions or unauthorised changes concerns you. When questions arise, pinpointing responsibility feels like a guessing game. And if you ever got a security breach, you aren't sure you could find what caused it.

Fortunately, there's a way to cast those worries aside and always have a clear trail at your fingertips.

The Activity Log plugin keeps a record of all important activities performed by your users within Matomo's platform. View all activities that happened in the past in chronological order to see the actions taken by your employees (or clients) with their respective timestamps.
