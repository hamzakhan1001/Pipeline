# White label Analytics platform

## Description

White Label plugin will:

* Boost the visibility of your own brand
* Strengthen the loyalty of your clients and users
* Change the Matomo header colour to your own branding
* Remove all the Matomo branded widgets from your users' dashboards
* Remove marketplace plugin teasers. For example, on the administration home page
* Remove the help page which promotes Matomo
* Remove several mentions of Matomo across the UI
* Whitelabel the tracking endpoints (piwik.js and piwik.php)
* Optionally, remove links that point to Matomo or Piwik
* Give you the possibility to change the product name from "Matomo" / "Piwik" to your chosen name

Provide your clients with personalised, white-label dashboards and reports. Elevate your brand identity and credibility with a seamless user experience.

Presenting analytics to your clients should elevate your agency's stature, not undermine it. But when third-party branding sneaks in, it clouds your professionalism and risks clients questioning whose brand they're truly engaging with, diluting the trust you've worked hard to establish.

Make Matomo unmistakably yours with the White Label plugin. Let your entire analytics display your brand. Ensure every report and dashboard builds on your reputation with zero confusion.

Next time you sit down to share insights with your clients, they'll only see one brand: yours.

### How White Label Works

#### Personalise Every Element of Your Dashboard and Reports

<div class="main-div-readme" style="display: flex;height: auto;">
<div class="left-div-readme" style="width: 50%;">
<p>Take Matomo's basic customisation beyond tweaking your logo and favicon and put your brand at the centre stage.</p>
<p>Change the product name as well as the background and font colours from Matomo's to your own. Present a dashboard that's unmistakably yours.</p>

#### Remove Third-Party Links

<div class="main-div-readme" style="display: flex;height: auto;">
<div class="left-div-readme" style="width: 50%;">
<p>Strip away Marketplace features, 'Help' icons and links, and any traces to Matomo. Removing marketplace plugin prompts, even on admin pages, ensures a focused and unambiguous experience for your users.</p>

#### Customise the Tracking Domains

<div class="main-div-readme" style="display: flex;height: auto;">
<div class="left-div-readme" style="width: 50%;">
<p>Alter your tracking endpoint, ensuring your clients only see your own domain (or any other one you want to use) when monitoring links or tracking conversions. It's discreet, professional, and all about your brand.</p>
