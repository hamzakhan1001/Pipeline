<p>Improving user experience may be a priority, but without the right data or buy-in, it's easy to second-guess your design changes.</p>
<p>With Matomo's heatmaps, you can translate complex user interactions into vivid, easy-to-grasp visuals. Heatmaps don't just represent data but a complete view of your visitors' behaviours.</p>

<p>Traditional web analytics give you mere glimpses of visitor interactions, like where they click or how long they stay. But this alone won't tell you much of the reasons behind their actions.</p>
<p>Overlay your Session Recordings with your visitors' profiles in Matomo to reveal a holistic view of their entire journey, from the pages they explore to their on-page behaviours. See the big picture and act with absolute confidence.</p>
