# Matomo AdminNotification Plugin

## Description

Adds the ability for Matomo administrators to include an informative message on all users' dashboards. This may be useful for communicating with users in larger shared environments. In our setup we were tracking 1,900 websites with 250 users. This is a solution we wrote to allow us to easily inform our users of maintenance windows.

## Instructions

The easiest way to install is to find the plugin in the [Matomo Marketplace](http://plugins.matomo.org/).

## Changelog

* 5.0.0 Matomo v5 compatible, not backwards compatible.
* 3.0.0 Piwik v3 compatible. Effort was made to maintain backwards compatibility. This should work all the way back to 2.12.x
* 0.1.2 Tested with Piwik v2.15 and included new registerEvents() hook for compatibility with Piwik 3.0
* 0.1.1 Cleanup. Removed plugin template verbiage from code files.
* 0.1.0 Initial Release

## Known Issues
