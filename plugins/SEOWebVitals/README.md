# SEO Web Vitals for Matomo

## Description

Discover how fast and user-friendly your website truly is based on Google's Web Vitals. Optimise your visitor experience and boost your search rankings.

Web Vitals is Google's initiative to measure the health of a website, focusing on the Core Web Vitals: loading, interactivity, and visual stability. According to Google, the faster a page loads and the easier and more visually stable one is, the better the user experience.

There's a strong correlation between a website’s Core Web Vitals performance and its search engine rankings. So by optimising the Core Web Vitals, you won't just improve user experience but also your site's rankings.

With the SEO Web Vitals plugin, you can track your site's Web Vitals performance, find issues related to the key metrics, and remediate them to enhance your user experience and search engine rankings.
