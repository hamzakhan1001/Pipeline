# Matomo FormAnalytics Plugin

## Description 

Get to know every detail of your forms with in-depth analytics. Make reliable decisions based on user interactions, and adjust your forms for higher conversions.

Your website's forms are often the gateway to conversions. They're essential for capturing leads, understanding visitor intent, and securing online transactions. But how do you know if they're performing at their peak?

Matomo's Form Analytics plugin dives deeper than typical analytics, revealing not just how many people visit your forms but also where they hesitate, what causes drop-offs, and which fields boost or hinder your conversions.

_“We made specific adjustments based on Form Analytics, resulting in 3 times the leads in just a couple of days.”_
