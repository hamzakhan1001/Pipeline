# Matomo RollUpReporting Plugin

## Description

Centralise your analytics data and get comprehensive insights across all your websites, apps, and stores in one consolidated dashboard.

Managing data from multiple websites and apps can feel like juggling too many balls at once. Each platform has its metrics, dashboards, and insights, leading to a messy and fragmented view. Worse yet, compiling all the data to get a clear picture of their situation takes too much time.

The Roll-Up Reporting plugin lets you aggregate data from multiple websites and apps into one single place. Access, analyse, and compare the data of multiple digital properties in one report, helping you instantly gain the insights you need, error-free.
