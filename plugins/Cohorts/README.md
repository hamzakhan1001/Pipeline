# Matomo Cohorts Analysis Plugin

## Description

Discover what keeps your visitors engaged over time. Identify and resolve churn bottlenecks to effectively lower your acquisition costs.

Imagine if you could peek into how different groups of your visitors or users behave throughout time. With cohort analysis, you can track groups of users for weeks or months after they take action on your site, such as signing up to newsletters or purchasing. Cohorts are the secret weapon to transform one-time visitors into long-term users, directly influencing your revenue and growth.

Go beyond collecting data and unlock the full picture of your usersâ€™ lifecycle with Matomo's Cohorts plugin. Follow the behaviours of new visitors and users, giving you a clear view of their engagement lifespan. Compare behaviours between converting and non-converting visitors and identify patterns for lowering your company's churn.
