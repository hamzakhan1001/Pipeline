# Matomo MultiChannelConversionAttribution Plugin

## Description

Learn how much each touchpoint and marketing channel is worth to your bottom line. Optimise your budget wisely and refine your strategy with solid data.

If you have ever stopped to think about where you put your money for the best return, you know how challenging it can be. The issue isn't just figuring out the last step a visitor took before converting; it's understanding their entire journey.

While many analytics tools, Matomo included, focus on last non-direct visits, a conversion story is more intricate. A visitor might engage with your brand multiple times across different channels before taking action. So, why settle for a glimpse when you can see the whole picture?

Unlock the power of attribution with the Multi-Channel Conversion Attribution plugin. Try and compare different attribution models to pinpoint the value of each visitor interaction. Clearly identify which channels fuel conversions and revenue and reallocate your budget where it matters most.
