## Description

**Crash Analytics** by Matomo: Uncover Errors and Elevate Your Site’s Performance.

Broken carts, glitchy checkouts, unresponsive contact forms – they're not just annoyances; they're revenue pitfalls waiting to happen.

13% of all pageviews come with lurking JavaScript errors that can cripple your visitors' experiences and jeopardise your revenue potential. Recent statistics reveal that [58%](https://www.retaildive.com/news/website-bugs-lead-to-cart-abandonment/549828/) of visitors are inclined to abandon purchases as a result of bugs, while an astonishing [75%](https://www.retaildive.com/news/website-bugs-lead-to-cart-abandonment/549828/) are driven to completely abandon websites due to these frustrating experiences.

To provide some context, consider a website that usually earns 25,000 EUR per month. If this site is encountering errors in 13% of all pageviews, it could potentially result in a monthly loss of 1,855 EUR.

With Crash Analytics, you can improve the user experience, boost conversion rates and grow revenue with 100% website reliability.

Even with the most rigorous tests, you can't foresee every glitch across diverse browsers, setups and scenarios. Factors like ad blockers, fluctuating internet speeds and evolving browser versions compound the complexity. This is where Crash Analytics excels.

**Crash Analytics for Matomo** empowers you to preemptively detect and efficiently resolve errors that could impact your conversions and bottom line. Here's how:

- **Reliability Out-of-the-Box:** Begin detecting crashes instantly with no configuration needed, giving you the power to resolve issues and enhance your site's performance right away.
- **Real-Time Crash Insight:** Catch errors in real-time, especially after deploying changes, so you're always on the pulse.
- **Proactive Alert System:** Stay ahead with instant alerts when an error occurs and scheduled crash reports, ensuring bugs never compromise your site's speed, user experience or bottom line again.
- **Holistic Insights:** Combine Matomo features such as segments, session recordings or visitor logs with crashes to dig deep and understand the user’s device, software and precise actions taken before encountering a bug.
- **Synchronising Developers and Marketers:** Bridge the gap between your technical team and marketing experts. Track emerging, disappearing and recurring errors, forward crash data to developers and prioritise fixes that matter.
- **Cross-stack Proficiency:** It's not just about JavaScript. Crash Analytics is your ally in tackling server-side crashes too – whether PHP, Android, iOS, Java or more.

**Finally, all your website metrics in one place.**

Matomo's traditional and behavioural web analytics, now enhanced with Crash Analytics.
